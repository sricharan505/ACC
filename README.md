Adaptive cruise control with obstacle avoidance.

Adaptive cruise control allows automated speed management of your vehicle. This system is capable of automatically slowing down or picking up speed by reacting to what is going on in front of it. This project focuses on the development of a microcontroller-based “Adaptive Cruise Control” system, which will detect obstacles and keep a safe distance between the car and the obstacle ahead, using PWM(pulse width modulation). Also added Obstacle Avoidance feature. I have used the following items:
1) Arduino Due.
2) Ultrasonic Sensors.
3) H-bridge(L298N).
4) chassis and motors.
